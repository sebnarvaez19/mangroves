# Spatial and temporal trends of EVI in Mangrove Forests coastal lagoons in the Colombian Caribbean

This research analysed the temporal trend of vegetation greenness, as measured by the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), in the Mallorquín, Totumo and La Virgen mangrove forests of the Colombian Caribbean Coast between 1996 and 2022, and its relationship with precipitation and discharge. Specifically, the temporal trend in EVI, precipitation and discharge was assessed through time series decomposition, autocorrelation and cross-correlation analyses. In addition, the effect of precipitation and interannual climate variability, as measured by the TNA (Tropical North Atlantic) and SOI (Southern Oscillation Index) indices on EVI were evaluated through a linear regression model. Results showed an increasing trend in EVI for Mallorquín until 2012, after which it stabilizes. EVI at this site had an annual seasonal pattern and was significantly correlated with precipitation and discharge at different lags. The mangrove forest at Totumo did not exhibit a clear long-term trend in EVI but it did show an annual seasonal pattern and a significant correlation with precipitation. At La Virgen, EVI showed an increasing trend until 2012 after which it declined until 2022. At this site, there was no clear seasonal pattern in EVI, while EVI was significantly correlated with precipitation. The linear regression model shows that precipitation was the only significant variable to explain EVI variability, and that its effect varied between sites. Changes in mangrove forest EVI at the selected sites may be explained by a combination of historic natural and anthropogenic factors, that include changes in coastal geomorphology, increased pollution, and infrastructure projects.
